        "\n",
        "ans>> Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects — self-contained units that combine data (attributes) and behaviour (methods). OOP models real-world entities using classes and objects, and emphasizes concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism to create reusable, modular and maintainable code."

For example, different classes can implement a speak() method and calling speak() on objects will execute class-specific behaviour. Polymorphism enables flexible and extensible code."
